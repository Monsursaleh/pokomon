## Pokemon Search Web Application

This is a web application that allows users to search for Pokemon by generation, type, and name. Users can select a generation using buttons or filter by type using checkboxes. They can also search for a specific Pokemon by name or ID.

The application uses the PokeAPI to fetch data about each Pokemon, including their name, image, type, and ID. The application then displays the Pokemon in a card format with their name, image, type, and ID.

## Usage

To use the application, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You can then select a generation using the buttons, filter by type using the checkboxes, and search for a specific Pokemon by name or ID using the search bar.
